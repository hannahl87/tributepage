            The Stone Roses are an English rock band formed in Manchester in
            1983.

            One of the pioneering groups of the Madchester movement in the late
            1980s and early 1990s, the band's classic lineup consisted of
            vocalist Ian Brown, guitarist John Squire, bassist Mani and drummer
            Reni.

          The band released their debut album, The Stone Roses, in 1989. The
          album was a breakthrough success for the band and garnered critical
          acclaim, with many critics regarding it as one of the greatest British
          albums ever recorded. At this time the group decided to capitalise on
          their success by signing to a major label. Their record label at the
          time, Silvertone, would not let them out of their contract, which led
          to a long legal battle that culminated with the band signing with
          Geffen Records in 1991. The Stone Roses then released their second
          album, Second Coming, which was met with mixed reviews in 1994.[2] The
          group soon disbanded after several lineup changes throughout the
          supporting tour, which began with Reni first departing in early 1995,
          followed by Squire in April 1996. Brown and Mani dissolved the remains
          of the group in October 1996 following their appearance at Reading
          Festival. Following much intensified media speculation,[3] The Stone
          Roses called a press conference on 18 October 2011 to announce that
          the band had reunited and would perform a reunion world tour in 2012,
          including three homecoming shows in Heaton Park, Manchester.[4][5]
          Plans to record a third album in the future were also floated.[6] In
          June 2012, Chris Coghill, the writer of the new film which is set
          during the Stone Roses 1990 Spike Island show, revealed that the band
          "have at least three or four new tracks recorded".[7][8] In June 2013,
          a documentary about the band's reformation directed by Shane Meadows
          and titled The Stone Roses: Made of Stone was released.[9] In 2016
          they released their first new material in two decades. The band
          members continued to tour until June 2017, at which point cryptic
          remarks by Ian Brown indicated the band may have split again.
